# Bringing AI to Intergenerational Income Support Research

## 🧠 Purpose

This folder provides a minimal, rigorous, and extensible framework for **human–AI collaborative data analysis** for our intergenerational Income Support dependency research, where the human serves as **philosopher–scientist** and the AI functions as a **modal translator and analytic executor**.

It establishes a project foundation rooted in:

- Epistemological clarity around welfare dependency research
- Reproducible reasoning for policy-relevant findings
- Modal fluency across data expressions (administrative records, survival models, policy reports)
- Domain-aligned semantics specific to Income Support and family dynamics

## 📂 ./ai/ Core Files

The following files and their contents serve as the foundation for this specific research project:

| File              | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `./ai/glossary.md`     | Defines critical Income Support and family dependency terms to prevent semantic drift |
| `./ai/logbook.md`      | Maintains a chronological, epistemic trace of analytic decisions, model changes, and research insights |
| `./ai/mission.md`     | Declares research axioms, epistemic stance, analytical methods, and policy goals |
| `./ai/onboarding-ai.md`| Instructs AI agents how to interpret Income Support research logic, ask for clarification, and translate between administrative data and policy insights |

## 🔁 Research Context

This framework supports research that aims to:
- Understand intergenerational transmission of Income Support dependency
- Maintain high interpretability in AI-assisted longitudinal analysis
- Avoid black-box decisions in policy-sensitive welfare research
- Structure team handoffs for long-running administrative data analysis
- Build cumulative knowledge over iterative modeling cycles across different cohorts and time periods

## 🧭 Getting Started

1. Review `./ai/mission.md` to understand the research purpose, axioms, and analytical goals
2. Familiarize yourself with Income Support terminology in `./ai/glossary.md`
3. Log all analytical decisions and model iterations in `./ai/logbook.md`
4. Ensure AI agents are prompted using the `./ai/onboarding-ai.md` structure for consistency

## 📊 Analytical Workflow Integration

This AI framework integrates with our research pipeline:
- **Data Exploration**: AI assists in understanding administrative data patterns
- **Model Development**: Collaborative development of survival and longitudinal models
- **Policy Translation**: AI helps translate statistical findings into policy-relevant insights
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic validation of assumptions and findings

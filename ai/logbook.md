## 2024-08-05: Project Initialization

### Setup and Scaffolding
- **Decision**: Adopted GovAlta quick-start-template structure for research organization
- **Rationale**: Provides proven framework for government analytics with AI collaboration infrastructure
- **Implementation**: Created directory structure and AI collaboration files
- **Next Steps**: Develop data access protocols and initial analytical pipeline

### Research Framework Establishment
- **Research Question Formalization**: How does Income Support dependency transmit across generations in Alberta families?
- **Study Design**: Retrospective cohort study using administrative data (1995-2024)
- **Primary Outcomes**: Adult child IS receipt following childhood family exposure
- **Analytical Approach**: Survival analysis with mixed-effects modeling for family clustering

### AI Collaboration Framework
- **Mission Definition**: Established epistemic and technical aims for intergenerational dependency research
- **Glossary Creation**: Defined 40+ key terms specific to Income Support and family dependency research
- **Methodology**: Human-AI symbiosis with human as philosopher-scientist, AI as modal translator

### Project Structure Implementation
- **Directory Structure**: Created complete analytical framework following GovAlta template
  - `ai/` - AI collaboration infrastructure (4 core files)
  - `analysis/` - Three-stage analytical pipeline (descriptive, models, sensitivity)
  - `data-private/` and `data-public/` - Data organization with privacy protection
  - `manipulation/` - Data processing pipeline (import, linkage, cohorts)
  - `scripts/`, `libs/`, `utility/` - Supporting infrastructure
  
- **Configuration Management**: 
  - Created comprehensive `config.yml` with research parameters
  - Study period: 1995-2024 (30-year observation window)
  - Child age cutoff: 18 years for adult outcome observation
  - Privacy protection: Minimum cell size 5, geographic aggregation
  
- **Main Pipeline**: 
  - `flow.R` orchestrates complete analytical workflow
  - Seven-stage pipeline: import → linkage → cohorts → descriptive → models → sensitivity → reporting
  - Integrated logging and validation at each stage
  
- **R Infrastructure**:
  - R project file for RStudio integration
  - Package installation script with 25+ required packages
  - Git ignore configured for administrative data protection
  
### Sample Analysis Implementation
- **Descriptive Analysis Template**: Created `population-characteristics.R` demonstrating:
  - Privacy-compliant summarization approaches
  - Family clustering considerations
  - Geographic and temporal pattern analysis
  - Missing data assessment protocols

### Privacy and Security Framework
- **Data Protection**: Comprehensive `.gitignore` preventing administrative data exposure
- **Access Controls**: Documentation of data access requirements and protocols
- **Reporting Standards**: Minimum cell sizes and aggregation requirements established

# Glossary: Intergenerational Income Support Research

> This glossary defines critical domain terms to prevent semantic drift during AI collaboration and ensure consistent interpretation of concepts throughout the research process.

## Core Concepts

**Income Support (IS)**: Alberta's provincial social assistance program providing financial assistance to individuals and families who cannot meet their basic needs through employment, other income, or resources.

**Intergenerational Dependency**: Pattern where children from families receiving Income Support subsequently receive IS as adults, suggesting potential transmission of dependency across generations.

**Family Unit**: The administrative definition used by Alberta Income Support, typically including parents/guardians and dependent children under 18 (or up to 22 if in school).

**Transmission**: The process by which Income Support dependency in one generation influences the likelihood of dependency in subsequent generations within the same family.

## Temporal Definitions

**Index Family**: The original family unit receiving Income Support, used as the starting point for intergenerational analysis.

**Index Period**: The time period during which a family first receives Income Support or reaches a specified duration threshold.

**Follow-up Period**: The observation window for tracking adult children's subsequent IS receipt, typically beginning at age 18.

**Exposure Window**: The period during childhood when an individual's family received Income Support.

**Lag Period**: Time between end of childhood IS exposure and potential adult IS receipt.

## Dependency Measures

**Dependency Duration**: Total length of time a family receives Income Support, which may include multiple episodes.

**Dependency Intensity**: Proportion of time receiving IS within a specified period (e.g., percentage of childhood years with family IS receipt).

**Dependency Onset**: Age at which an individual first receives Income Support as an adult.

**Dependency Recurrence**: Pattern of returning to Income Support after a period of non-receipt.

**Chronic Dependency**: Extended periods of Income Support receipt, typically defined as 24+ months of continuous or near-continuous receipt.

## Family and Demographics

**Birth Cohort**: Group of individuals born in the same year, used for age-standardized comparisons.

**Family Structure**: Composition of the family unit (single parent, two-parent, extended family, etc.).

**Family Transition**: Changes in family composition (marriage, divorce, death, children aging out, etc.).

**Sibling Effects**: Differences in outcomes among children within the same family.

## Geographic and Contextual

**Service Area**: Geographic regions used for Income Support administration and policy implementation.

**Labor Market Region**: Economic geographic areas with similar employment characteristics and opportunities.

**Rural/Urban Classification**: Geographic designation affecting service delivery and economic opportunities.

**Economic Context**: Local and provincial economic conditions during the observation period.

## Program and Policy Terms

**Employability Program**: Training, education, or work experience programs designed to increase employment prospects.

**Transitional Benefits**: Support provided during transition from Income Support to employment.

**Asset Limits**: Maximum allowable assets while maintaining IS eligibility.

**Earnings Exemption**: Amount individuals can earn while maintaining partial IS benefits.

**Program Reform**: Major policy changes affecting IS eligibility, benefit levels, or program structure.

## Analytical Terms

**Exposure Cohort**: Individuals who experienced family Income Support during childhood.

**Comparison Cohort**: Individuals from similar backgrounds who did not experience family IS during childhood.

**Time-to-Event**: Duration from a specified starting point (e.g., age 18) to IS receipt onset.

**Censoring**: Individuals who do not experience the outcome (adult IS receipt) during the observation period.

**Competing Risks**: Alternative outcomes that prevent observation of the primary outcome (death, permanent disability, emigration).

## Risk and Protective Factors

**Risk Factor**: Characteristic or circumstance associated with increased likelihood of intergenerational IS transmission.

**Protective Factor**: Characteristic or circumstance associated with decreased likelihood of transmission.

**Mediating Factor**: Variable that explains the mechanism through which transmission occurs.

**Moderating Factor**: Variable that affects the strength of the relationship between exposure and outcome.

## Data and Measurement

**Administrative Data**: Government records collected for program administration purposes.

**Data Linkage**: Process of connecting records across different administrative systems using personal identifiers.

**De-identification**: Removal or encryption of personal identifiers to protect privacy.

**Validation Window**: Period used to assess data quality and completeness.

**Missing Data**: Information not available in administrative records due to system limitations or privacy restrictions.

## Ethical and Policy Context

**Privacy Impact Assessment**: Evaluation of potential privacy risks and mitigation strategies.

**Data Stewardship**: Responsible management and use of administrative data for research purposes.

**Policy Relevance**: Extent to which research findings can inform program improvement and policy development.

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Involvement of program administrators, policy makers, and community representatives in research design and interpretation.

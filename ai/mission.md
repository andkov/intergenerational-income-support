# Research Mission: Intergenerational Income Support Dependency

> This file serves as a compass for AI collaborators, articulating the project's purpose, epistemic stance, and analytic goals. It ensures that all AI agents operate within a shared framework of understanding, aligned with the human analyst's intentions for studying intergenerational welfare dependency.

In a human–AI creative symbiosis, the human serves not merely as an operator, but as a **philosopher–scientist**—the conductor of meaning. Their role is to define the framework within which the AI can execute and translate, but not originate, analytic purpose.

## Research Request Context

This research emerges from policy concerns about intergenerational transmission of Income Support dependency in Alberta. Administrative data suggests that children from families with extensive IS history may have higher rates of subsequent IS dependency as adults, but the mechanisms, risk factors, and policy intervention points remain unclear.

## Epistemic Aims
*(What do we want to learn?)*

### Primary Epistemic Goals

1. **Transmission Mechanisms**: Understand how, when, and why Income Support dependency transmits across generations within families.

2. **Risk Stratification**: Identify family, individual, and contextual factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of intergenerational dependency transmission.

3. **Critical Periods**: Determine temporal windows (child age, family structure changes, policy contexts) when intergenerational transmission risks are highest.

4. **Protective Factors**: Identify circumstances, interventions, or characteristics associated with breaking intergenerational dependency cycles.

5. **Policy Leverage Points**: Understand where and when policy interventions might most effectively interrupt intergenerational dependency patterns.

### Secondary Epistemic Goals

- **Geographic Variation**: How do intergenerational patterns vary across Alberta regions, urban/rural contexts, and economic conditions?
- **Program Effectiveness**: Which existing programs or services are associated with reduced transmission risk?
- **Temporal Changes**: How have intergenerational patterns changed over time with policy reforms and economic cycles?
- **Family Structure Dynamics**: How do family composition changes affect dependency transmission patterns?

## Technical Aims

## Methodological Framework

### Analytical Approach
- **Study Design**: Retrospective cohort study using administrative linkages
- **Temporal Scope**: 30-year observation window (1995-2024)
- **Statistical Methods**: Survival analysis, mixed-effects modeling, causal inference approaches
- **Validation Strategy**: Multiple robustness checks, sensitivity analyses, and external validation

### Ethical Framework
- **Privacy Protection**: All analyses use de-identified data with privacy safeguards
- **Bias Mitigation**: Systematic attention to selection bias, measurement bias, and confounding
- **Equity Considerations**: Explicit attention to how findings might affect vulnerable populations
- **Transparency**: Open methodology and reproducible analysis where data privacy permits

## Success Criteria

This research succeeds if it:
1. Provides robust evidence about intergenerational IS transmission patterns and mechanisms
2. Identifies actionable policy intervention points with supporting evidence
3. Establishes analytical infrastructure for ongoing monitoring and evaluation
4. Contributes to broader understanding of intergenerational poverty and social mobility
5. Maintains highest standards for data privacy and research ethics

## Constraints and Limitations

- **Data Constraints**: Limited to administrative records; no direct measures of family dynamics or individual motivation
- **Causal Inference**: Observational data limits causal claims; focus on association and prediction
- **Temporal Scope**: Historical data may not reflect current policy and economic contexts
- **Privacy Requirements**: Reporting constraints to protect individual and family privacy
